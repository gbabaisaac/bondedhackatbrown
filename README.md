# bondedhackatbrown

Single-repo hackathon snapshot with the Bonded frontend and Link backend.

## Layout
- `frontend/`: copy of the Bonded-Official app. Work with this folder when discussing the UI or mobile app.
- `backend/`: copy of the Link service. You can run and debug the backend from here.

## Workflow
1. Continue developing the frontend and backend in their original repositories (`/Users/isaacgbaba/Bonded-Official` and `/Users/isaacgbaba/link-service`).
2. When you need to prepare a new submission snapshot, remove the existing `frontend/` and/or `backend/` folders, copy the latest versions in, and commit the refresh.
3. Keep this repo as the single, clean history you’ll submit for the hackathon.

## Running
- Follow each project’s own README inside `frontend/` or `backend/` to install and run the apps locally.

## Submission
- Push this repo to the hackathon remote (e.g., `origin` on bondedhackatbrown).
- Keep continuing the real work in the separate repos—this one is just a bundled snapshot.
